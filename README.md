# WeatherAndFoodmenuApp

# Introduction
This Android app was made for a school course. The user can check the current temperature from desired city or check OUAS's Kultturelli's food menu for the day.

# How does it work?
Weather data is gathered via OpenWeatherMap's API and the temperature is parsed from the JSON-file. The food menu data is parsed from our university's food menu API.
